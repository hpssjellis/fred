## 🛠️ What You Get
If you support our collective, I’ll **personally mentor** a small group of your students (3–7) through the **first 4 TinyML labs**:  

- 📷 **Image Classification**  
- 🧠 **Object Detection**  
- 🔊 **Keyword Spotting**  
- 🌀 **Motion Classification & Anomaly Detection**  

All labs are:  
- **Hands-on & hardware-based**  
- **Deployable without the cloud**  
- Designed to teach **real ML systems skills** without expensive infrastructure
