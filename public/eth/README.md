#    My attempt at solving just one ETH compsci problem.

Why do I make lots of files?  Because I always break my own code and have to go back a few steps to find a working version that I can then rebuild with the new code.

The github for all this code is at [https://github.com/hpssjellis/fred/tree/main/public/eth](https://github.com/hpssjellis/fred/tree/main/public/eth)


The website demo equivalent of this page is at  [https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/](https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/)

## These are links to the website version of the above github .html files.


1. [ast01.html](https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/ast01.html)     crap

1. [ast02.html](https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/ast02.html)      loading array

1. [ast03.html](https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/ast03.html)     crap

1. [ast04.html](https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/ast04.html)     crap

1. [ast05.html](https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/ast05.html)     Presently here getting it parsed, now trying to add distance and time. 

1. [split01.html](https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/split01.html)  testing splits works but wrong

1. [split02.html](https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/split02.html)  bit cleaner   but wrong

1. [split03.html](https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/split03.html)  trying converted from c++

1. [split04.html](https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/split04.html)  showing results

1. [split05.html](https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/split05.html)  split and list using recursion not the shift operators. A bit more complex. I probably will not use this.

1. [ast06.html](https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/ast06.html)  Kind of doing stuff, not really working yet. An OK code backup 

1. [ast07.html](https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/ast07.html)   Potion add may be wrong

1. [ast08.html](https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/ast08.html)   latest as a proper link


## LOL, I understood the question wrong. I thought the distance and times must be added in the order given.

1. [max-d-min-t01.html](https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/max-d-min-t01.html)  Attempt to optimise a list of distance and time for max distance min time

1. [max-d-min-t02.html](https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/max-d-min-t02.html)  works

1. [max-d-set-t01.html](https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/max-d-set-t01.html)  now with set time indicies are bad

1. [max-d-set-t02.html](https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/max-d-set-t02.html)  attempt 2

1. [max-d-set-t03.html](https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/max-d-set-t03.html)  attempt 3, Now this works.

1. [max-d-set-t04.html](https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/max-d-set-t04.html)  BigInt safe

1. [max-d-split-t01.html](https://hpssjellis.github.io/fred/public/eth/max-d-split-t01.html)  add split and list (meet in the middle code) Uggghh it is incorrect somehow.
